# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

A static-HTML marketing site for **Solaris Wireless** — a Miami-based electronic device supplier and distributor (mobile phones, laptops, IoT, Starlink, components) for institutional buyers. The site is hand-written HTML/CSS/vanilla-JS, deployed on Vercel, with one serverless function (`api/contact.js`) handling lead form submissions via Gmail API + Google Sheets.

There is **no build step**. Files in the repo are exactly what ships. Static-site-generation is a deliberate constraint (see `youtubeseovideo1.txt` — Google must crawl pre-rendered HTML).

## Repository Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.html` | Homepage. Single source of truth for the hero, about, capabilities, 9-card flip-card grid, presence/map, contact form, footer. |
| `products/*.html` | 6 product category pages (mobile-devices, laptops, iot-smart-cameras, starlink-connectivity, consumer-electronics, specialist-hardware). |
| `case-studies/*.html` | 5 case studies (google-fortune-500, ritual-kiosk, mvno-network-operator, government-military, specialist-hardware). |
| `blog/*.html` | 5 long-form posts + `blog/index.html`. |
| `legal/*.html` | privacy-policy, terms. |
| `css/styles.css` | Global styles (~2700 lines) — used by every page. Includes responsive breakpoints, flip-card animation, navigation, footer. |
| `css/blog.css`, `css/case-study.css` | Per-template overlays loaded *in addition to* `styles.css` on those page types. |
| `js/main.js` | Single shared vanilla-JS bundle. Self-guards each feature (e.g. `if (!document.getElementById('ctrack')) return;`) so it's safe to load on any page. Handles the client ticker, mobile nav, reveal-on-scroll, flip-card tap (mobile), and contact form POST to `/api/contact`. |
| `api/contact.js` | Vercel serverless function. POST handler that runs three Gmail-API + Sheets-API operations in parallel: (1) append lead row to Google Sheet, (2) email notification to `NOTIFY_EMAIL`, (3) confirmation email to lead. |
| `backend/server.js` | Local-dev Express equivalent of `api/contact.js`. Same logic, also serves the static site at `http://localhost:3001`. Used for local testing only — production runs on Vercel. |
| `llms.txt` | AI-crawler manifest at the root. Hand-written summary of company facts, products, services, FAQ, and full URL map. Update when facts change. |
| `robots.txt` | Explicitly allow-lists 21 named AI crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended, Applebot-Extended, etc.) and disallows `/api`, `/backend`, `/node_modules`. |
| `sitemap.xml` | Manually maintained. Update `<lastmod>` on touched pages. |
| `vercel.json` | Old `/pages/*.html` URLs → hash-anchor redirects on the homepage. |
| `pages/` | Empty placeholder folder (paths redirected by `vercel.json`). |
| `design-aesthetic-test-4/`, `design-aesthetic-solaris-wireless-test-5/` | Old design experiments. Ignore — not deployed. |

## Common Commands

```bash
# Local preview of static site only (no contact form)
open index.html

# Local dev with working contact form (requires backend/.env)
cd backend && npm install && npm start
# → serves site at http://localhost:3001 and handles /api/contact

# One-time Gmail OAuth setup for the contact form (see backend/GMAIL_SETUP.md)
cd backend && node get-token.js

# Deploy to production: just push to the client remote.
# The client Vercel project (`solaris-website-202604`) is connected to
# the client GitHub repo (`buntea-99/solaris-website-202604`), so any
# push to main auto-builds and auto-deploys to solariswireless.com
# within ~40 seconds. No vercel CLI command needed.
git push origin main && git push client main
```

There is no test suite, no linter, and no build step.

## Deploy Workflow

The repo has **two GitHub remotes**:

- `origin` → `Vdebug/solaris-wireless-website` (code-mirror backup, no Vercel attached)
- `client` → `buntea-99/solaris-website-202604` → Vercel project `solaris-website-202604` → `solariswireless.com` (production)

The client Vercel project auto-deploys from `main`. Do NOT run `vercel --prod` manually — the manual deploys go to a different (now-defunct) Vercel project that does NOT serve solariswireless.com. The only correct deploy step is:

```bash
git add <files> && git commit -m "..." && git push origin main && git push client main
```

That alone updates production. Watch deploy progress at https://vercel.com/dashboard (client account) or via `vercel ls solaris-website-202604 --token $VERCEL_TOKEN`.

The personal Vercel project (`prj_4NdOrHstG6ORqFvx6HUMjxHnNFWT`) was retired; `.vercel/project.json` is permanently linked to the client project (`prj_LaSpx4qm8mcpzEZQTUOxaUDo30Ak`). Do not switch it back.

**After a commit, push to both remotes** (origin = backup mirror, client = production):
```bash
git push origin main && git push client main
```

Then deploy to production:
```bash
VERCEL_TOKEN=$(grep VERCEL_TOKEN .env | cut -d= -f2) vercel --token $VERCEL_TOKEN --prod
```

## Architectural Conventions

**One stylesheet, one script.** Every page links `css/styles.css` and `js/main.js`. Don't fragment styles into per-page files unless adding a per-template overlay (`css/blog.css`, `css/case-study.css`) which loads *in addition to* `styles.css`. `js/main.js` self-guards every feature — keep it that way so the file remains safe to load on any page.

**Nav and footer are duplicated, not templated.** Editing the navigation, phone number, footer copy, or logo means touching every HTML file (~17 pages). Use a single `perl -i -pe 's|...|...|g'` sweep across `index.html`, `products/*.html`, `case-studies/*.html`, `blog/*.html`, `legal/*.html`. Verify with `grep -rn` afterwards.

**Logo asset rules.**
- Top nav: `images/logo-transparent.png` (dark text, transparent background — works on light header).
- Footer: `images/logo-footer.png` (white-on-dark variant — needed because footers have a dark background).
- Avoid `images/logo-main.jpg`; it has a white rectangle background and renders poorly on dark backgrounds.

**SEO files are first-class.** `llms.txt`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` are not "extras". Update `llms.txt` whenever company facts change (founding year is **2013**, Google-vendor-since is **2016** — these are separate facts; do not conflate). Refresh `<lastmod>` in `sitemap.xml` when touching a listed page.

**Schema.org JSON-LD lives inside `<head>`.** Homepage has 4 blocks: Organization, WebSite, FAQPage, BreadcrumbList. Product pages have a WebPage block with publisher Organization sub-block. When adding new content, mirror this pattern — don't strip schema.

**Punctuation.** No em-dashes (`—`) anywhere, period. Not in visible copy, not in HTML comments, not in CSS comments, not in `llms.txt`/`llms-full.txt`, not in JSON-LD descriptions. Replace with commas, colons, or full stops. The site has been swept twice; em-dashes keep creeping back in via new content. After any blog/page edit, run `grep -rln "—" index.html blog/ products/ case-studies/ legal/ llms.txt llms-full.txt css/ robots.txt` and fix anything that returns. Use commas for parenthetical asides.

**Contact form contract.** The form on the homepage POSTs to `/api/contact` (production) or `http://localhost:3001/api/contact` (local). Field names: `firstName`, `lastName`, `organisation`, `email`, `interest`, `message`. The serverless function (`api/contact.js`) and the local Express server (`backend/server.js`) implement the same handler — keep them in sync if you change the schema.

**Environment variables (Vercel + `backend/.env`).** Both deployments share the same six vars: `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID`, `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `GMAIL_USER`, `NOTIFY_EMAIL`, `SHEET_ID`. They are configured per-Vercel-project; pushing code does not propagate them.

## Memory About Past Decisions

- **Founding year is 2013** (not 2016). The Google-approved-vendor relationship started 2016 — that's a separate stat.
- The company is positioned as an **"electronic device supplier and distributor"**, not "hardware/technology supplier". Titles, meta tags, hero, about, capabilities, footer all use this framing.
- Phone number is `+1 (305) 222-7353`. Both `tel:+1-305-222-7353` href and `+1 (305) 222-7353` display string must match across all pages.
- Em-dashes were scrubbed site-wide. Don't reintroduce them.
- The 9-card flip grid on `index.html` uses a mix of inline brand SVGs (Republic Wireless wordmark, Ritual sky-blue square, Google G in colour) and PNG icons in `images/icon-*.png` (body cam, capitol, laptop). Card icons were upscaled 4× via `ffmpeg ... -vf scale=iw*4:ih*4:flags=lanczos` to fix pixelation.
- The `youtubeseovideo1.txt` file is a transcript of an SEO masterclass — kept in the repo as reference for the AI-SEO strategy used here.

## Off-Site SEO Action Checklist (User Must Do Manually)

The on-page work is comprehensive (33+ pages, schema, llms.txt, og:image, breadcrumb/HowTo schema, 10 vertical solution pages, 12 BOFU/comparison blog posts). The remaining ranking gains require external account creation that cannot be automated:

1. **Google Search Console** — verify `solariswireless.com` ownership (DNS TXT or HTML meta verification), submit `https://solariswireless.com/sitemap.xml`, request indexing for the 53 URLs (10/day API limit, so plan ~6 days). This is the highest-leverage off-site action: without GSC, Google indexes much more slowly.
2. **Google Business Profile** — claim listing as "Electronic Equipment Supplier" at the Miami address. Triggers local search appearances for "electronic device supplier Miami" and similar.
3. **Clutch.co** — DA 90+ B2B directory cited heavily by Perplexity. Create company profile with keyword-rich description matching the homepage `<meta description>` framing.
4. **ThomasNet.com** — Industrial B2B directory. Register under "Electronic Components" and "Mobile Communications Equipment" categories.
5. **G2.com / Capterra** — B2B software/service review platforms. Less relevant for hardware supply but worth a profile for AI Overview citation surface.
6. **Wikipedia secondary citation** — get Solaris Wireless cited as a source on a relevant electronics-distribution Wikipedia page (do not create own page; secondary citations are higher trust). Watch the Pacific MVNO and Cook Islands telecoms pages for citation opportunities.
7. **HARO / Connectively / SourceBottle** — answer journalist queries on telecom and procurement topics; earn .com/news backlinks.
8. **LinkedIn Company Page** — confirm "Founded 2013", Miami FL, `solariswireless.com` linked. Publish 1 article/week recycling blog post intros to drive employees and clients to like/share/comment (engagement signal).
9. **Reddit / Quora seeding** — answer relevant questions on r/sysadmin, r/Procurement, r/MVNO, Quora device-procurement topics with genuine, non-promotional answers that mention Solaris Wireless where the context fits. AI engines (Perplexity, ChatGPT) heavily index Reddit and Quora.
10. **OEM partner listings** — request listing on Apple Authorised Reseller, Samsung Approved Reseller, Lenovo Business Partner, Dell Technologies Partner directories where applicable.

After the off-site actions are seeded, monitor citation appearance:
- Ask Perplexity, ChatGPT and Claude weekly for queries like "wholesale Android phones for MVNOs USA", "Google approved vendor electronic devices", "bulk phone supplier institutional", "Starlink wholesale distributor". Track when Solaris Wireless first appears in citations or answer body.
- In Google Search Console, watch for impressions on the BOFU blog posts and solution pages. The first 4-6 weeks should show indexing; ranking improvements typically begin at week 8-12 after directory citations are live.
